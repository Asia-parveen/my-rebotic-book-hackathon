# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Content Outline

This module explores the integration of vision, language, and action systems in robotics, focusing on how robots can understand natural language commands, perceive their environment, and execute appropriate actions. It covers state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models and their applications in humanoid robotics.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this module, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems in robotics
- Implement multimodal perception systems that combine vision and language
- Design robot action planning systems that respond to natural language commands
- Integrate VLA models with robot control systems
- Evaluate the performance of VLA systems in real-world scenarios
- Address challenges in multimodal understanding and action execution
- Apply VLA systems to humanoid robotics applications
